<h1>Introduction of the project paper</h1>
<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This report aims to thoroughly present its readers with the details of a project aiming to design a machine learning system in order to improve the solar panel quality inspection business process of quality assurance and technical compliance consulting firm specializing in solar photovoltaics, namely Sinovoltaics. This system may act as a part of a bigger decision support system (DSS), described detailly in the paper “Designing a System for Data- driven Risk Assessment of Solar Projects”, which is a system to assess technical risks associated with photovoltaic (PV) projects using a data-driven approach.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solar panel quality inspection process of the solar panel assembly line or manufacturing plant performed by Sinovoltaics mainly consists of having inspectors performing a series of tests and rating the line or plant based on industrial standards. Although such practice has been effective for years, it is considered both cost- and time- consuming due to the man-hours involved in onsite inspections. Also, onsite inspections mean an extended time is needed to study a manufacturer. Machine learning has been field and utilized to achieve automation and improve business processes in many sectors. With the historical records of inspections being available, which may act as data, introducing machine learning as a means to reduce man-hours and improve the solar panel quality inspection process may redeem as feasible.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in this paper, I will explore the possibility of utilizing machine learning techniques in the solar panel quality inspection process, with a purposed model presented, through studying the case of Sinovoltaics.
